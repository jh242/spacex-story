# SpaceX Story

A web app dedicated to all past, present and future SpaceX missions.

This is a personal project intended to showcase all of my web development abilities. With a mission to Mars drawing closer and closer,
I thought it would be a good idea to make a little website to show people where the company who made it possible has been so far.

## Major libraries (tentative)

A list of significant libraries I'm using to make this possible:

- Redux
- Bootstrap
